// usage: #include kkossev.TuyaZigbeeLibrary
//  #include's parameters (if one can call them that) is namespace, followed by a dot, followed by name. Names and namespaces can include letters (upper/lower case), numbers, dots, dashes, and underscores.
//  Required attributes are namespace, name, description, and author.
// All apps/drivers using include are recompiled when include gets a change. Each driver uses the same version of a library. You put common code in the library, and driver specific code in the driver itself.
